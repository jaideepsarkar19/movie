    "rating": 7.9,
    "summary": "A decent movie with a good message. There are some people who responded with as not much of a crime thriller or an 1960's movie storyline. But one thing women and children abuse are increasingly high only post 2000. So these kind of movie let's the parents know to educate boys on how they should behave with women and how to educate girls about the society and how rotten it got into. Overall a good attempt, and my kudos to the director and actors."
